# Dapr 1.12.4

This update includes bug fixes:

## Mitigate race condition in placement table during sidecar restarts

### Problem

When restarting a significant deployment on Kubernetes (> 20 pods), many pods will be removed from placement table. When the restarts happens concurrently with leadership changes in placement service, the placement table can get into a corrupt state that requires the restart of placement service [#7311](https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/7311)

### Impact

Impacts users running Dapr 1.12.0-1.12.3 that uses actors and deployments with many sidecar instances.

### Root cause

Race condition between placement leadership changes and placement table updates due to pods being terminated.

### Solution

Mitigate by reducing the chances of leadership changes in placement service and fix a bug that can cause terminated pods to remain in placement table forever.
