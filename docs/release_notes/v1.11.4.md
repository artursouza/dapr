# Dapr 1.11.4

This update includes a fix for handling errors for Actors via the `X-Daprerrorresponseheader` HTTP header. 

### Problem

The Dapr's .Net SDK returns actor exceptions via a special response with the exception serialized in the response body and adding the `X-Daprerrorresponseheader` HTTP header. This exception was not handled correctly starting at version 1.10, resulting in a generic error message at the calle's side.

See https://github.com/dapr/dapr/issues/6339

### Impact

Actor exception details are lost and a generic message is returned instead.

### Root cause

Retry logic in sidecar was dropping the error details returned by the actor method.

### Solution

Fixed the retry logic to save the error's payload and return it in the end of the actor invocation logic.
